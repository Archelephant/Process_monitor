# Process_monitor

This Python script was created and tested with Python 3.6

External dependencies: 
- psutil
- pandas

For precautionary measures, compile the script using py2exe into executable and use the flash drive on test systems - it will store in pandas-readable .csv files into the "\data" subfolder.

And don't forget to change the "decimal = ","" parameter!
